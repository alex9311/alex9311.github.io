In 2022, some fellow UCSB crew alumni and I decided to go backpacking in the Sierras.
We initially were planning on the popular Thousand Island Lake area but didn't manage to get passes.
In browsing the recreation.gov website for wilderness permits that hadn't sold out yet, we saw Beck Lakes in the Inyo National Forest.

Beck Lakes is "next door" to the Thousand Island area and is accessed via the Devils Postpile National Monument area.
None of us had heard of the area before and trip reports were pretty sparse, but we decided to go for it anyway.
What we discovered was a quiet trail system full of pristine alpine lakes and a great mix of dramatic rock faces and quiet forests.

We planned a three day trip that loop through several lakes and gave us a lot of options to pick camp spots as we went.
The big picture was a counter-clockwise loop using the Superior Lake Trail, Holcomb Lake Trail, and Summit Meadow Trail.
The loop had several out-and-back options to different lakes along the way.

### Day 0: Travel and Prep
I flew direct from Seattle to Fresno on Friday afternoon to meet my friend Demi who lives there.
After a quick Chipotle dinner, we headed off to Mammoth Lakes.
This drive goes through Yosemite National Park which is one of the most scenic drives in the country.
The valley is absolutely massive all around you as you drive into, through, and out of it.

We met Lucas and Evan at an AirBnb in Mammoth Lakes.
I love staying in Mammoth in the Summer, accommodations are very inexpensive compared to winter and the town is quiet.
We did a bit of gear prep and food shopping, but it was mostly just fun to be together with old friends again.

### Day 1: Elevation and Thunder
It was about a 45min drive from our bnb to the Devils Postpile Trailhead.
Since we weren't in peak season, we were able to drive our own car directly into the monument visitor area.
I believe there is a bus system that must be used when accessing the trailhead in peak season.
Before setting off on our, we took the short walk to the Devils Postpile National Momument.

We started up the Beck Lake trail around 11am.
The trails starts off around 7500ft elevation and is a pretty consistent climb for the first five miles all the way to 9300ft.
Around mile five, we got some rolling hills and flat trails with great views of the surrounding mountains.

At mile 6.5, there is a fork in the trail.
One can either go right (off the main loop), toward Superior and Beck Lakes, or continue left along the main loop.
We went right.
Around mile 7.5, we reached our first lake of the loop: Superior Lake.
Superior Lake was awesome, we enjoyed a break and some snacks by its side.
We decided to push on to Upper and Lower Beck Lakes before calling it a day though.

On our way up to Lower Beck Lake, some weather started to roll in.
There were a few pretty spooky thunderclaps and lightning strikes nearby, though we felt somewhat safe being in a valley rather than exposed on a ridge.
We eventually took shelter under some trees, but not before we all got quite soaked for the rest of the day.
We eventually pushed on and found Lower Beck Lake.
This was the highest point of the whole weekend for us, at about 9600ft elevation.
Though the lake was dramatic and beautiful, all the area surrounding was rocky and exposed -- not ideal for campsites.
There were a few one or two person potential sites, but nothing for our group of four.

We decided to go back down towards Superior Lake and camp in a spot we had noticed on the way up.
We found it eventually and were satisfied enough with it to call it a day.
It had a stream nearby, tree cover in case of more rain, and flat/soft dirt ground.

### Day 2: Swimming in Holcomb Lake and Posh Campsite
We woke up to a wonderful view of the ridge above our campsite getting lit up by the rising sun.
After enjoying some oatmeal and letting the sun thaw us out a bit, we got packed up and started hiking.

The first section of the day was hiking the 1.5 miles back to to the main loop.
Only a half mile further along, we took the option to leave the main loop again.
This out-and-back would be to visit Noname and Holcomb Lake.

Our surroundings went from shady forests to more exposed rocky scenery.
We had a few great views of King Creek as it ran down the rocks and even formed a few small waterfalls.

We got a little lost on the way to Noname lake but found the trail again using our GPS apps.
We were finally fully dried out by the time we reached Noname lake and the sun was fully coming out.
With a plan to have lunch at Holcomb, we only stayed at Noname for a short break.

Holcomb turned out to be our favorite lake of the whole trip.
The weather was perfect, the lake was deep and clear, and we had it nearly to ourselves.
There was even a perfect jumping rock!
We all had a swim in the lake and enjoyed lunch in the sun.

From Holcomb Lake, it was about 1.5 miles back to the main loop.
After about 1.5 more miles along the main loop, we took our final out-and-back towards Fern and Anona Lake.
Fern Lake is only a quarter mile from the main loop.
Exploring around Fern Lake for a bit, we found some really great campsite options.
We debated about whether we should push on to Anona with all our gear or leave our gear behind at a camp at Fern Lake.
We ultimately decided it was worth bringing our full packs up to Anona so we'd have the option to camp there.

The hike up to Anona was pretty steep and rocky, but it was fun to see Fern lake from such a high vantage.
After gaining the ridge above Fern, it was a pretty short walk to Anona.
We wandered around Anona for a while looking for a site but didn't find any we liked as much as the spots around Fern Lake.
We were particularly worried about having enough tree cover in case of rain.

We trekked back down to Fern lake and set up camp for the night.
Our site had plenty of tree cover, flat areas for several tents, and even a rock table and log benches to eat at.


### Day 3: Hike out
On our final morning, we woke to a perfectly still Fern lake just a hundred yards from our camp.
The moon and the ridges surrounding the lake were mirrored exactly in the glassy water.

The hike out was our shortest day.
There were a few sections through forests that had burned in the previous years that were more exposed and sandy -- slowing our progress a bit.
What stuck out from the day was the scale of the views looking East.

### Wrap Up
I'd highly recommend the Beck Lakes area.
It was quiet, beautiful, accessible, and there are lots of routing options.
There are several more lakes we didn't visit, and there are even exciting summit routes from up the nearby Iron Mountain for those inclined to bag the peak.

At a personal level, this trip was very important to me.
It was the first meaningful "adventure" I'd had since my foot surgery in March 2022 and it went perfectly.
Nothing beats good company and nature all around you!
